## Task 1 - Car Price Prediction ğŸš—

ğŸ”¹ Goal: Build a regression model to predict car prices using machine learning.  
ğŸ”¹ Dataset: CarPrice_Assignment.csv (from Kaggle).  
ğŸ”¹ Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.  
ğŸ”¹ Model: Random Forest Regressor.  
ğŸ”¹ Metrics: RMSE, MAE, RÂ² Score.  

### Workflow:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.  
2. Train-test split.  
3. Applied pipelines (numeric + categorical).  
4. Trained Random Forest model.  
5. Evaluated performance and plotted results.
